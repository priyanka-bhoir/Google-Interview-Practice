# 133. Clone Graph
```PS
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 //Solution

 class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null) return null;
        
        Node newNode = new Node(node.val,new ArrayList<>());//cloned Graph
        
        // hashMap
        HashMap<Node,Node> hashMap = new HashMap();
        hashMap.put(node,newNode);   
        
        //Queue
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList();
        queue.add(node);
        
        //vising node
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            //search neghbors of top node
            Node polledOrigNode = queue.poll();
            
            for(Node origNeighbor : polledOrigNode.neighbors){
                //if no neighbor then node needs to be cloned and added to map
                //check if map contains 2 then 3
                if(!hashMap.containsKey(origNeighbor)){
                    Node newNeighborNode = new Node(origNeighbor.val,new ArrayList<>());
                    hashMap.put(origNeighbor, newNeighborNode);
                    queue.add(origNeighbor);
                }
                hashMap.get(polledOrigNode).neighbors.add(hashMap.get(origNeighbor));
            }
        }
        return newNode;
    }
