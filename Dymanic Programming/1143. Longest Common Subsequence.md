# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
```PS
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

//Solution
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        char[] s1= text1.toCharArray();
        char[] s2 = text2.toCharArray();
        int[][] T = new int[text1.length()+1][text2.length()+1];
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<T.length;i++){
            for(int j =1 ;j<T[0].length;j++){
                if(s1[i-1]==s2[j-1]){
                    T[i][j] = T[i-1][j-1]+1;
                }else{
                    T[i][j] = Math.max(T[i-1][j],T[i][j-1]);
                }
                if(T[i][j]>ans) ans=T[i][j];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
