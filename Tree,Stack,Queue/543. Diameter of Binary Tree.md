# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
```PS
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 ```
 //Solution
 class Solution {
    int ans;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        ans = 0;
        depth(root);
        return ans;
    }
    public int depth(TreeNode node){
        if(node == null) return 0;
        int L = depth(node.left);
        int R = depth(node.right);
        ans = Math.max(ans,L+R);
        return 1+Math.max(L,R);
    }
}
