# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
```PS
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

```
//Solution
class Solution {
    int max= Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
       helper(root);
        return max;
        
    }
    public int helper(TreeNode root){
         if (root == null){
            return 0;
        }
        int L = Math.max(helper(root.left),0);
        int R = Math.max(helper(root.right),0);
         max = Math.max(max,root.val+L+R);
        return root.val+Math.max(L,R);
        
    }
}
