# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
```PS
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
```

//Solution
public class Codec {

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return "X";
        String Lser = serialize(root.left);
        String Rser = serialize(root.right);
        return root.val+","+Lser+","+Rser;
        
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        Queue<String> nodeLeft = new LinkedList<>();
        nodeLeft.addAll(Arrays.asList(data.split(",")));
        return deserializeHelper(nodeLeft);
    }
    
    public TreeNode deserializeHelper(Queue<String> nodeLeft){
        String valueForNode = nodeLeft.poll();
        if(valueForNode.equals("X")) return null;
        TreeNode nodenew = new TreeNode(Integer.valueOf(valueForNode));
        nodenew.left = deserializeHelper(nodeLeft);
        nodenew.right = deserializeHelper(nodeLeft);
        return nodenew;
    }
}
