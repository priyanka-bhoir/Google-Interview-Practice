# 968. Binary Tree Cameras
```PS
You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

 ```
 //Solution
 class Solution {
    int numCamera = 0;
    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root) == -1? numCamera+1:numCamera;
    }
    private int dfs(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int left = dfs(root.left);
        int right = dfs(root.right);
        if((left ==-1) || right == -1){
            numCamera++;
            return 1;
        }
        if(left == 1 || right == 1){
            return 0;
        }
        return -1;
    }
