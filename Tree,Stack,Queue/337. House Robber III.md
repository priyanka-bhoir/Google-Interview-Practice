# 337. House Robber III
```PS
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

 
```
//Solution
class Solution {
    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        int[] ans = helper(root);
        return Math.max(ans[0],ans[1]);
    }
    public int[] helper(TreeNode node){
        if(node == null){
            return new int[]{0,0};
        }
        int[] left = helper(node.left);
        int[] right = helper(node.right);
        
        int rob = node.val+left[1]+right[1];
        int notRob = Math.max(left[0],left[1])+Math.max(right[0],right[1]);
        return new int[]{rob,notRob};
    }
}
