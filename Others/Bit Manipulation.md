Bit Manipulation is a technique used in a variety of problems to get the solution in an optimized way. This technique is very effective from a Competitive Programming point of view. It is all about Bitwise Operators which directly works upon binary numbers or bits of numbers that help the implementation fast. Below are the Bitwise Operators that are used:

Bitwise AND (&)
Bitwise OR (|)
Bitwise XOR (^)
Bitwise NOT (!)
