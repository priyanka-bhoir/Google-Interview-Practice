# Factory method design pattern in Java
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/factory-method-design-pattern-in-java/
```
It is a creational design pattern that talks about the creation of an object. The factory design pattern says that define an interface ( A java interface or an abstract class) for creating object and let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The factory method in the interface lets a class defers the instantiation to one or more concrete subclasses. Since these design patterns talk about the instantiation of an object and so it comes under the category of creational design pattern. If we notice the name Factory method, that means there is a method which is a factory, and in general, factories are involved with creational stuff and here with this, an object is being created. It is one of the best ways to create an object where object creation logic is hidden from the client. Now Letâ€™s look at the implementation.
