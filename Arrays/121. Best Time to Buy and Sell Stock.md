# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
```PS
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

            if(prices[Buy] > prices[i]) Buy = i;
            profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - prices[Buy]);
